# VSA operator properties

[Vector Symbolic Architectures](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr)
or [Hyperdimensional Computing](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12559-009-9009-8) systems
are computational systems designed in terms of carefully chosen operators
applied to high-dimensional vector spaces.
VSAs appear to be robust to a wide range of choices of the specific vector space and operators.
This raises the question of which properties are required for VSAs
and how those relate to the choices of vector space and operators.

In this project we construct a reasonable parameterisation of VSA operators
and map out the algebraic properties of VSA operators
as a function location in the parameter space.
To the extent that the practical uitility of VSA operators
follows from their algebraic properties,
this map will help in understanding and designing VSA computational systems.

# Project structure

We are using the {[workflowr](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr)} package 
to structure the project so that the work is computationally reproducible
and all the materials and outputs are openly accessible.


# Installation

*Instructions yet to be written.*

*Yet to be decided whether to binderise the repo.*

* Files for creation of the output paper are in the `paper` directory.
  * This directory was created by the {[rticles](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rticles)} package,
  using the `PeerJ`template.
  (This will change if we find a different publication venue for the paper.)
  * The paper uses data objects and figures created by the simulation notebook
  and stored in the `output` directory.
  
* Bibliography records are manually exported from Zotero and stored in the `???` directory
