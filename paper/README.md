# Paper

The files for creation of the output paper go here.
It was created with the `{rticles}` package.
It is not managed by `{workflowr}` and the paper must be manually generated by explicitly knitting it.

`paper.pdf` in this directory is a symlink to the file `docs/paper.pdf`.
Knitting the paper updates the symlink here,
which in turn updates the file in `docs`.
