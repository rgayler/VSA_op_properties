# Paper

The files for creation of the output paper go here.
This folder and most of its contents were created with the [`{rticles}`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rticles) package.

This directlory is not managed by [`{workflowr}`](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr) and the paper must be manually generated by explicitly knitting it.

* `paper.Rmd` - The source text for the final output paper.

* `paper.pdf` - The rendered final output paper.
This is a symlink to the file `docs/paper.pdf`.
Knitting the paper updates the symlink here,
which in turn updates the file in `docs/`.
