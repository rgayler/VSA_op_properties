# Introduction

* Something like the introduction of [Schlegel et al 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11797)

* Note the focus on implementation (biological or artificial).
This may influence some of the mathematical choices made later.
Emphasise that the maths is a *model* of implementable systems rather than free-standing maths.
  * RG vaguely remembers recently seeing a mention of graph-structured computation
  (i.e. data flow graphs rather than graphs as the subject of computation)
  as a known area of study.
  Check whether this area is of any use to us (CG?).
  * This point about focus on implementation 
  is most likely relevant in that parenthesization of math expressions to represent associativity
  translates into alternate wiring of the implementation data flow graph.
  
* A data flow graph is probably actually an oriented *hypergraph*,
where hyperedges correspond to operators/functions with distinguished arguments and output,
and vertices correspond to HD vector values (thought of as 'registers' if you like).
  * Side question to CG: Vector space maths seems to be written as though there's only one vector space.
  In an implementation there are (arguably) as many vector spaces as there are vertices in the data flow hypergraph.
  Is this a relevant distinction and worth pointing out?
    * For example, we generally assume that each of the vertices has the same dimensionality,
    but that's not essential, and in the biological setting it's unlikely.
    * Along the same lines, permutation operators feel completely different in a biological setting:
    The input and output vertices are generally not identical dimensionality;
    The neurons aren't nicely indexed, that's externally applied labelling; 
    Given that arbitrariness, every connection between two registers is a permutation.
    * Also, in mathematical and artificial systems we can easily have permutations and their inverses,
    whereas in biological systems inverse permutations are implausible.
