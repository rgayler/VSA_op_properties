This notebook contains the simulations
informing the content of output paper.
In addition to the simulations
it contains notes on the coding and interpretation of the simulations.

Data and figures to be used in the output paper
must be saved to the `output\` directory.

The only cross-references possible are to section headers.
These can be within- or between-file cross-references.

Use only user-assigned section reference labels (instead of reference labels automatically generated from the section header text),
so that the section header text can be changed without changing any reference labels that are used, e.g.

  ```
  ## Some text for a section header {#a-user-defined-ref-label}

  As noted in [some other file](#some_other_file_name.htmlsome-other-ref-label)
  ```

```{r setup}
# chunk labeled 'setup' automatically executed on R session restart

library(DiagrammeR) # for GraphViz diagrams
```

## Data flow graph {#data-flow-graph}

Diagrams to illustrate the point that the maths needs to be compatible with implementation.

The graphs have a fixed topology.
Each edge and vertex corresponds to some fixed, specific hardware.
You are not going to have an arbitrarily large graph to deal with arbitrarily long inputs.

Here is the translation of $A + B$ to a circuit.

Note that the sum operator has two distinct inputs (arbitrarily labeled $L$ and $R$)
corresponding to the two arguments to the $sum$ function,
and that we have adopted the convention of mapping the left and right operands of $+$ 
to the $L$ and $R$ inputs.

```{r dfg-sum-ab, fig.cap="Example data flow graph for (A + B)."}
# export diagrams to SVG for inclusion in output paper?

# A + B
# sum(A, B)
#
# The implementation is inherently noncommutative because the two inputs are distinct
# although the calculation it implements may be commutative

grViz("
  digraph sum_a_b {
    
    # HD input values
    node [shape = none]
    A; B
    
    # HD anonymous output values
    node [shape = plaintext]
    output [label = '']
    
    # operator
    node [shape = circle]
    op [label = 'sum(L, R)']
    
    # connections
    A->op [headlabel = 'L']
    B->op [headlabel = 'R']
    op->output
  }
")
```

Mathematical script can be ambiguous with respect to translation to a circuit.
For example, given $A + B + C$ and a binary $sum$ operator
the script does not specify the order in which the $sum$ operations take place.
Operation ordering in the math script is indicated by parentheses, e.g. $(A + B) + C$
indicates that the first $sum$ operator takes $A$ and $B$ as its arguments,
and the arguments to the second $sum$ operator are the ouput of the first  $sum$ operator and $C$.

This is illustrated in the second diagram.
Note that the two $sum$ operators are distinct realisations of the the same abstract function.

```{r}

# ((A + B) + C)
# sum(sum(A, B), C)
#

grViz("
  digraph sum_a_b_c_left {
    
    # HD input values
    node [shape = none]
    A; B; C
    
    # HD anonymous output values
    node [shape = plaintext]
    output [label = '']
    
    # operators
    node [shape = circle]
    op1 [label = 'sum(L, R)']
    op2 [label = 'sum(L, R)']
    
    # connections
    A->op1 [headlabel = 'L']
    B->op1 [headlabel = 'R']
    
    op1->op2 [headlabel = 'L']
    C->op2 [headlabel = 'R']
    op2->output
  }
")
```

The math script $A + B + C$ could also be realised as $A + (B + C)$, which is shown below.
If $((A + B) + C) = (A + (B + C))$ then the operator $+$ is described as associative (otherwise it is non-associative).

In math script, if $A + B + C$ is to be interpreted as $(A + B) + C$ then $+$ is described as left-associative,
and if it is to be interpreted as $A + (B + C)$ then $+$ is described as right-associative.
Note that this left- or right-associative terminology is only needed 
for dealing with the ordering ambiguity within math-script when the operator is non-associative.
This ambiguity doesn't exist within VSA circuits
because the data flow graph specifies the ordering.
So left- or right-associativity is not a property of VSA circuits. 

On the other hand, associativity is a property of VSA circuits.
Saying that the $sum$ operator is associative
is an assertion that the circuits corresponding to $(A + B) + C$ and $A + (B + C)$
will always produce identical results.

```{r}

# (A + (B + C))
# sum(A, sum(B, C))
#

grViz("
  digraph sum_a_b_c_right {
    
    # HD input values
    node [shape = none]
    A; B; C
    
    # HD anonymous output values
    node [shape = plaintext]
    output [label = '']
    
    # operators
    node [shape = circle]
    op1 [label = 'sum(L, R)']
    op2 [label = 'sum(L, R)']
    
    # connections
    B->op1 [headlabel = 'L']
    C->op1 [headlabel = 'R']
    
    A->op2 [headlabel = 'L']
    op1->op2 [headlabel = 'R']
    op2->output
  }
")
```

Now consider the case where we wanted a circuit to produce the VSA representation of a list 
(say, $\{A, B, ... I ... Z\}$) from representations of the items ($A$, $B$, etc.),
for the purpose of emulating a psychological list memory experiment.
We might decide that the desired representation is $A + B + ... + I + ... + Z$ for some suitable definition of $+$.
Translation of this mathematical description into a circuit raises some problems.

Firstly, a VSA circuit should have a fixed topology whereas the list length varies between lists
and lists are arbitrarily long.

Secondly, the list items are encountered separately in sequence
whereas the math script does not reflect this temporal aspect.

An obvious solution to this is to set up a circuit with a single $sum$ operator
and to sequentially accumulate the input items $A_i$
into a cumulative memory representation $M_i$.
*(I have no idea what an appropriate math script equivalent of this would be.)*

The following circuit shows the heart of this.
What it omits are mechanisms for:

* parsing the input stream into discrete items
* recognising the beginning and end of the list of items
* initialising the cumulative memory representation $M_i$ at the beginning of the list
* control and gating of the signals flowing around the circuit

These are typically assumed away in mathematical psychology models,
so I'm going to do the same here.

Note that if the $L$ and $R$ arguments of $sum$ are to be treated differently
this is equivalent to saying that $sum$ is noncommutative because $sum(A, B) \ne sum(B, A)$.

An obvious possibility here is that the arguments of $sum$ could be weighted differently to (de-)emphasize the most recently added item.
With some VSA realisations it may be possible to weight the arguments using a unary scalar multiplication operator.
In other realisations (e.g. BSC) there is no unary weighting operator
but it would be possible to define a weighted $sum$ operator.

```{r}

# M_(i+1) := M_i + A_i

grViz("
  digraph cumulative_update {
  
    # HD input values
    node [shape = none]
    A [label = 'A@_{i}']
    
    subgraph {
      rank = same
    
      # operator
      node [shape = circle]
      op [label = 'sum(L, R)']

      # HD cumulative memory value
      node [shape = plaintext]
      M [label = 'M@_{i}']
    }
  
    # HD anonymous output values
    node [shape = plaintext]
    output [label = '']
    
    # connections
    A->op [headlabel = 'L'; headport = nw]
    M->op [headlabel = 'R'; headport = ne]
    
    op->M [tailport = s]
    M->output
  }
")
```
