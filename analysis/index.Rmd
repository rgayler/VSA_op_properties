* [Simulation notebook](simulation.html)

This notebook contains the code for simulations informing the paper.
It also contains notes on the design and implementation of the simulations
and notes on the interpretation of the results.

At this stage it is presumed that the paper will be a separate document
that refers to the results generated by the simulation notebook.

* [Skeleton paper](skeleton.html)

This document roughs out the contents of the final output paper.
The skeleton may be updated to *be* the output paper
or it may be retained as separate document
(yet to be decided).

* [Output paper](../paper/paper.pdf)

*Currently, this link doesn't work.
I need to work out how to make the output paper available locally and on the GitHub Pages website.*

The final form of the output document
that will be uploaded to an appropriate archive
and submitted to a publication venue.
